## [Project 1: National Survey by Household Sample in Brazil - (PNAD)](https://github.com/Marcus-Bernard0/Data-Science-projects/tree/master/1%20-%20Projeto%20PNAD)
This is my first project, containing basic statistics, visualization of data, and how is in development, maybe I will use machine learning with the framework Sklearn. 
Nonetheless, my objective was to find insights buried in this dataset. 
To make it easier to comprehension, I made a dashboard in Power Bi.

__How the dataset are about Brazil, I plotted the graphics with language in Portuguese. If this procedure is wrong, give me feedback to improve my next projects about Brazil__

- In this project, I analyze the distribution of money for social classes.
- What class make more money?
- Long-time study influences??
- Which states pay more?
